              Keep Track is a local-first personal finance app. Your financial data — transactions, budgets, debts, goals, and savings — lives entirely on your device. We never see it, store it, or have any access to it. Even with Keep Track Plus, we only store an opaque encrypted file on your behalf. We cannot open it, read it, or recover it under any circumstances.
            </Section>

            <Section title="What We Collect">
              <p className="mb-3">We collect only the minimum needed to operate accounts and subscriptions:</p>
              <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-none">
                <Li>
                  <strong>Account identity</strong> — your name and email from Google Sign-In, used only to identify your account and link it to a subscription.
                </Li>
                <Li>
                  <strong>Subscription status</strong> — whether your account has an active Plus subscription. Processed by Stripe. We do not store card details.
                </Li>
                <Li>
                  <strong>Support messages</strong> — your name, email, and message when you contact us. Used solely to respond to your inquiry.
                </Li>
              </ul>
            </Section>

            <Section title="What We Do Not Collect">
              <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-none">
                <Li>Your financial records of any kind — transactions, budgets, debts, savings, goals, or categories. None of this ever leaves your device in a readable form.</Li>
                <Li>The contents of your cloud backup. When you sync, we receive and store a single encrypted file. It is encrypted on your device with your password before upload. We have no key, no access, and no ability to recover it.</Li>
                <Li>Device identifiers, advertising IDs, or behavioral analytics.</Li>
                <Li>Any data from users on the free tier — there is no account, no server communication.</Li>

            </Section>

            <Section title="Cloud Sync (Plus)">
              Keep Track Plus gives you a server to link your devices together. When you sync, your app uploads a single encrypted file to our storage. That file is encrypted on your device using a password only you know — before it ever leaves your device. We store the file as an opaque blob. We cannot decrypt it, read it, or recover it if you lose your password. You own your data entirely. We are just the pipe.

              <ul className="flex flex-col gap-2 list-none">
                <Li>To authenticate you and associate your account with a Plus subscription.</Li>
                <Li>To store your encrypted backup file so your devices can retrieve it.</Li>
                <Li>To respond to support requests.</Li>
                <Li>To manage billing via Stripe.</Li>
